### Overview 

- The Frontend of Starbucks sends REST calls to middleware KONG Gateway which is backed by 3-Node Cassandra cluster. The KONG routes the REST calls to respective tenant backends which are independent Starbucks store.
 
- Frontend of our app is written in Angular JS. It has: 

  (i)  home page  - can select Store 1, Store 2, Store 3.

  (ii) home page of selected Store - can select and add products to cart.

  (iii) cart page - add/remove item in cart, update size/quantity. Once products are confirmed, order status changes to PLACED,   and overtime it changes to PREPARING, SERVED and COLLECTED.

  (iv) order page - can view order id and status of order.

- The Middleware is implemented through KONG API Gateway.The Gateway routes the calls to respective Backend Microservice to handle the request.

- The Backend of Starbucks is writtten in JAVA to handle CRUD operations on resources. It is backed by 3 Node Mongo-DB cluster.
